# Limitations
1. Twitter has a query limit: 180 queries per 15 minute 
2. You can search with maximum number of 100 tweet. I'm doing this with 10 last tweet.
3. I tested it with popular search keywords, like ‘javascript’. If you’re searching for less used words, you probably just need to check each new tweet with your last tweet that has been retweeted.
